1. Access via VNC

Once QEMU is running, follow these steps to access and configure Windows Server:
	â€¢	Enable Remote Desktop in Windows Server settings.
	â€¢	Disable CTRL+ALT+DEL in Local Security Policy.
	â€¢	Set Windows Server to never sleep.

2. Compress the Windows Server Image

After configuration is complete, compress the Windows Server image. Replace xxxx with your chosen Windows version (e.g., windows10):

```
dd if=windowsxxxx.img | gzip -c > windowsxxxx.gz
```

3. Install Apache

Install Apache to serve the compressed file over the web:

```
apt install apache2
```

4. Allow Apache through the Firewall

Grant Apache access through the firewall:

```
sudo ufw allow 'Apache'
```

5. Move the Windows Server File to the Web Directory

Copy the compressed Windows Server file to Apacheâ€™s web directory:

```
cp windowsxxxx.gz /var/www/html/
```

6. Get the Download Link

After moving the file, you can access it through your dropletâ€™s IP address:

```
http://[Your_Droplet_IP]/windowsxxxx.gz
```

Example:

```
http://188.166.190.241/windows10.gz
```

7. Deploy Windows Server on a New Droplet

To run Windows Server on a new droplet, use the following command. Replace LINK with your actual download link:

```
wget -O- --no-check-certificate LINK | gunzip | dd of=/dev/vda
```

Important Notes:
	â€¢	Replace xxxx with the correct Windows version.
	â€¢	Make sure to use the correct download link for your file.
